# _Project-RLPIC_

Network coding is a simple yet powerful technique to improve the performance of the
communication systems significantly. The fundamental concept of NC is to perform arbitrary
coding operations on the contents of packets rather than the direct replication and forwarding
implemented in traditional store-and-forward networks. In particular we are using PICOD technique
with relay assisting to achieve optimizing one or more parameters using a heuristic approach
based on prior research works existing in the domain.
